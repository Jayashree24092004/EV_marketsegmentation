EV Market Segmentation and Forecasting (India)
 Project Overview:

This project analyzes the Electric Vehicle (EV) market in India to identify the most promising customer groups and geographic regions for startups to target. The project applies market segmentation frameworks and forecasting models to deliver data-driven recommendations for EV adoption, customer targeting, and future demand.

 Objectives:

Identify top EV-adopting states in India (2019â€“2022).

Segment customers into meaningful groups using clustering.

Classify regions into high-adoption and low-adoption markets.

Forecast future EV demand using time-series models.

Provide strategic recommendations for startups entering the EV market.

ðŸ›  Technologies & Concepts Used:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels

Machine Learning:

K-Means Clustering â€“ Customer segmentation

Decision Tree Classifier â€“ Geographic segmentation

ARIMA Time-Series â€“ Sales forecasting


Market Segmentation Frameworks:

Geographic (state-wise adoption)

Demographic (age, income, spending patterns)

Behavioral (buying trends, adoption rate)

Temporal (seasonal/monthly demand trends)

Dataset Details:

1. Demographics_Data.csv â€“ State-wise EV sales (2019â€“2022).
2. Ev_2_Wheeler_Sales_by_years.csv â€“ Monthly EV two-wheeler sales.
3. Additional customer-level demographic dataset (Train/Test) for segmentation tasks.

Workflow

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing â€“ Cleaning and structuring state-wise and monthly EV datasets.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Identifying top EV adoption states, yearly growth, and seasonal trends.
3. Customer Segmentation (K-Means) â€“ Grouping buyers into clusters like young professionals, families, and cost-conscious commuters.
4. Geographic Segmentation (Decision Tree) â€“ Classifying states into high- and low-adoption zones.
5. Time-Series Forecasting (ARIMA) â€“ Predicting future EV demand up to 2026.
6. Strategic Insights â€“ Recommending target markets and customer groups for startups.
